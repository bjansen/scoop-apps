This is a quickstart repo for Orchid to get you up and running as soon as possible. The only system dependency 
necessary to run Orchid is a valid Java 8 JDK and git. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orchidhq/OrchidStarter.git
cd OrchidStarter
./gradlew orchidServe

# View your generated site at http://localhost:8080/
```

Alternatively, you can click the button below to automatically clone this repo and deploy it to Netlify. This starter 
repo includes the [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), so you will be up and publishing content as soon as 
possible. You will need to set the Github user/repo in `src/orchid/resources/config/netlifyCms.yml`, but the rest of the 
CMS config is automatically generated based on your current Orchid plugins and configurations.
